## Muir
The Primary world of the Frostgale setting.



**Moons:**
- Noralee (pure white)
- Tymalee (pale violet)
- Janas (pale orange)
- Koras (pale blue)
- Moradras (crimson)
- ~~Eraednas~~ (pale green) (disappered long ago, may have been fictional)
	- **History Check DC 15:** 
			*This moon commonly known as Eraed was depicted in many ancient works of art and refferenced in 			historical accounts. It is thought that maybe a 6th moon was metaphorical or a creative 						addition made to works in the past, as the moon doesn't exist today and no accounts were made 			of it's disapperance. *
	- **History Check DC 25:** Eraednas' spirit was contained within Tygan Baenare after he was destroyed in the Valley of Tears, known then as the White Valley, during the Battle of Defiance (5679AF). He allowed Tygan to pull him from the sky in an effort to destroy Tygan's betrayers.
