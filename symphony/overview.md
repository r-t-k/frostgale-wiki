# Verses

Each verse contains both inhabited planets and unhabited planets all orbiting a Source. The source of each verse is a conduit and reflection of the Forces of the Symphony. A source is formed by a Binding Notation and a Lyrical Accompaniment. Catalysts and Shapers build the frame of a Verse while The Maker sings life into it.

Each inhabited planet will have a number of moons corresponding with the strength of its connection to the source. 

Moons are conduits and vessels of a source's power.

More moons means stronger magic for a planet.
