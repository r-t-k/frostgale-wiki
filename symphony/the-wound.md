# Summary

The Wound seeks to corrupt the Source of Azuunand use it to corrupt other Verses. It must corrupt each planet to reach it. Muir is the strongest in magic, and last in the line of defense.

The Wound is a Cataylst of The Symphony who betrayed The Maker.

# Origin


## Excerpt from *The Shaping*, a text found on Muir:

“The Wound formed out of dissonance within the Last Verse. 

“The Maker chose a Catalyst and his favorite Shaper, of whom He was most proud, to draft a Verse of their own  inspiration. Yon’Wyvalandel, known to Him as the greatest among the least and holy among all other Shapers, and Garramandyr a powerful Catalyst, performed their work for Him within the Halls of Symphony. 

“It was beautiful and His Students filled Him with pride. [The Maker referrers to those above Existence as his Students rather than Servants or Children]

“Unlike the rest, this Verse was different in His eyes, filled with the works of the minds who thought differently and knew far less yet were wise.

“Without Lyrics, the Verse brought forth only notes. After some time, He looked down and spoke to his Students.

I AM PLEASED WITH YOUR MUSIC, RHYHADNANYM AND DTHANTHYYM. YOU UNDERSTAND MORE THAN THE OTHERS, SHARE UNTO ME THE BREATHS WHICH YOU HAVE WRITTEN. I AM WANT TO LISTEN.

“‘Holiest Teacher, Master Above, it is known to you that we are without writ to do as you have sought.’ Said the Shaper.

YES STUDENT, NO BREATH MAY BE WRITTEN APART FROM ME, A HEARTH IS FRAMED BY MANY YET ONLY FIRE BRINGS WARMTH, NOTHING BARES ALTERNATIVE, FIRE ALONE BRINGS WARMTH TO A HEARTH AS FIRE IS BOURNE UNTO SPECIFIC CREATION, HELD BY ITS FETTERS UNTO THE LAWS. IN THIS, I AM THE FETTERS, BINDING THE BREATH UNTO MY OWN ACTION ALONE. 

UNTO YOU I HAVE GIVEN TRUST AND UNTO YOU I HAVE GIVEN POWER, NO OTHERS BEFORE YOU BORE THESE. YET A STUDENT BETRAYS THESE GIFTS, SEEKING WHICH MAY NEVER BE HAD.

I AM WANT TO LISTEN.

“The Shaper spoke in return. ‘Most Holy, Master Above, I swear to you upon my bonded soul, if I have sought to betray thee by action or want —curse me to the abyss among the filth for I am not worthy of your eyes. Know this, never did my spirit seek to do anything but honor your Name above all things with joy as I have lived.’

YOU ARE ALSO BETRAYED YOUNG ONE. 
NOW I AM WANT TO LISTEN.

“The Catalyst sang out breaths of his corrupt heart, filling the Verse with his own purpose. 

“The Maker spoke after he finished. 
YOU KNOW NOT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.

“Garramandyr, looked upon The Maker, and spoke as he saw into His eyes.

‘I have created Children of my own. Though I may not give them Truth and Life of the Symphony, I have bestowed upon them essence of my own making. Sorrow. —Sorrow fuels progress far better than the Balance. I am tired of watching your creation spin a wheel of time passing with repetition. I am tired of being fettered to your whimsy. 
You have no purpose planned for Existence other than Existence itself.’

‘I am the bringer of the winds and the reaver. I am the shadow who eats the light. I am the fire that thirsts. I am the author of lies in pursuit of truth. I am death for those who cannot die.’

‘I bring unto your creation a choice. Blind servitude in You or my progress. I am eternal, no Force of yours binds me any longer. I live in the heart of all things. I curse you for forging my heart with ambition and binding me with servitude. You created me knowing I would bear sorrow and sought only to comfort yourself. I will unmake your creation and forge it anew in my image.’ 

‘I am my own Father. I am own master. I name myself Odaezun —Sorrow Incarnate, and Damnation as my home.’

“Thus the Wound was formed before the Maker, and it fled to a plane of its own creation, to oversee its handiwork — the Verse of Azomere wrought with corruption. “
