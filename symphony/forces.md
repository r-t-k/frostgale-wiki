Magic of the Verse of Azuun are naturally Symphonic Forces, however the Wound created his own force within the Weeping plane which is fueled by chaos. 

True magic - provided by symphonic forces directly (not through a source), rarely used or understood.

Arcane Magic - directly from the source.  

Druidic magic - provided by the source channeling through a planet. 

Divine magic - provided by gods channeling from the Source. 

Lyric magic - power held by those with the eyes of Shaping.

Weaving Magic (the Interlude) - is planar and of an unknown origin.

Sorrow - magic provided by the Wound.
