# Magic

Magic of the Verse of Azuun are naturally Symphonic Forces, however the Wound created his own force within the Weeping plane which is fueled by chaos. 

True magic - provided by symphonic forces directly, rarely used or understood.

Arcane Magic - directly from the source.  

Druidic magic - provided by the source channeling through a planet. 

Divine magic - provided by gods channeling from the Source. 

Lyric magic - power held by those with the eyes of Shaping.

Weaving Magic (the Interlude) - is planar and of an unknown origin.

Sorrow - magic provided by the Wound.

Most magic is divine, except recently on Muir with the Exodus of the Gods following the Hubris of the Patrons with the ending of the Great War. Men and Elves usurped the Gods and badly replaced them. Arcane magic is now most prevalent. In reality the Gods are dead, slain with the assistance of the Wound
