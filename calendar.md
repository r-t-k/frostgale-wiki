The Ardean Calendar is based primarily on wind patterns, which bring warmer or cooler weather with the changing seasons. The trade winds from Muir’s oceans are consistent every Ardean year. Rather than months, Ardean’s use the term “Breaths” to describe the periods which divide the year. The Ardean Calendar year is as follows:

 
>1. **Firstbreath**
>2. **Stormblow**
>3. **Fairbreeze**
>4. **Brightwind**
>5. **Dragon’s breath**
>6. **Sailrest**
>7. **Tribute**
>8. **Bloodgale**
>9. **Tempest**
>10. **Whitewind**
>11. **Frostgale**

**There are four weeks of nine days in each Ardean Month**

Days are simply called by their order: Firstday Seconday etc..
