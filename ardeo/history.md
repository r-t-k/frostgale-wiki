## Dating Systems

Among the three systems over the course of history, the major difference was who was keeping the records. The Founding System is widely considered to be most accurate mainly due to the fact that ancient Imperial Archivists were not politically motivated in their record keeping. Few records using the later systems were ever telling the whole story by design, as they were secrets best kept by the patrons.

## Ages of History
>*Many consider the founding of the Empire to be the beginning of history. I'm sure that ancients such as old Haedron and his court of white haired prunes would disagree, but I have it on good authority that few things of importance really happened until after The Pact was written and the Pearlescent Stones were carved and etched with The Concordant. Yes in fact, having known one of its nine authors rather well, the long forgotten tales of old were "really nothing more than squabbling houses, young dangerous sorcerors, and small folk, all the same occassionally having to avoid being enslaved by a giant dragon or used as fuel for some demon's weapon", as he used to say indifferently. Small wonder why anyone who isn't a veteran of 100 or more wars and a mythic sorceror would be even casually curious. It was a strange state of affairs back then, Drow, Dragons, old magic, truly an enchanting young world free of scars left by the hubris of bitter and foolish men.*

These heroes are immortalized as the Founders of The Empire, both in reference to the first and second incarnations of the Ardean Empire, though often only the names of the first six are mentioned. It's also very rare to find a complete listing of all the founders as both Baenres, Randon VanKai, Artus Gilgaleam, Durandon Orubar, and Haedron were officially struck from the records and censored from historical accounts under the reign of Emperor Issak Oberskyr. After the Eighth Age and Before the Eleventh age, few knew the truth.

> *Upon returning to aide his wife Ameilia, in excorting House Baenre and their people of the realm of Caranthir into Tygan's Citadel for protection against the Athrian Troops and the immenient return of Klauss, Tygan returned to find his entire House brutally massacred and his family tortured to death. Tygan's resulting fury ended in the greatest battle ever fought, one man against the entire Imperial Army lead by Issak Oberskyr, laying seige to the strongest fortress ever built, Tygan won and the remaining forces retreated. The entire Imperial Army was decimated resulting in nearly one million casualties at the hands of Tygan alone before he was finally murdered in the ruins of his home the following evening. The ancient lands of House Baenre are now largely under sea or left a barron wasteland of toxic magic as a result of Tygan's unrivaled output of magical force. To date, there is only one instance recorded when a sorceror was capable of shaking the entire planet.*
