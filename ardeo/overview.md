## Calendar
The Ardean Calendar is based primarily on wind patterns, which bring warmer or cooler weather with the changing seasons. The trade winds from Muir’s oceans are consistent every Ardean year. Rather than months, Ardean’s use the term “Breaths” to describe the periods which divide the year. The Ardean Calendar year is as follows:

 
1. **Firstbreath** - Harsh winter weather diminshes into a thaw
2. **Stormblow** - Spring rains and heavy storms
3. **Fairbreeze** - Favorable trade winds and mild weather
4. **Brightwind** - Strong trade winds and warm weather
5. **Dragon’s breath** - Summer storms and high temperatures
6. **Sailrest** - Little to no wind, heat transistions to mild
7. **Tribute** - Trade winds return, mild heat. (Harvest season)
8. **Bloodgale** - Mild to cold Weather, Trade winds dwindle. (Festival Season)
9. **Tempest** - Cool temperatures, extreme storms, shifts into freezing
10. **Whitewind** - Mild Freezing wind (hardly there), no storms, freezing temperatures
11. **Frostgale** - Extreme Blizzards

**There are four weeks of nine days in each Ardean Month**

Days are simply called by their order: Firstday Seconday etc..
