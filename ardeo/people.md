## Human Races
## Elven Races
### Aldaen
Near god-like beings, purest blood certainly of the divine or some similarly powerful origin.
These are one of two Elven Creator races, and as such an entire branch of spin off races have developed from them.

Emerging sometime long before the First Empire, they appeared in line with the introduction of magic in Ardeo in the far distant past.

Typical Build: Broad and Muscular (male), Thin and Fit (female)
Average Life Span: 5000 - immortal

#### Abilites and Powers
Of all the known races on Muir, the elven creator races naturally possess the highest innate level of magical attunement, so much so that they can live thousands of years without any investment into extending their lifespan. 

Moreso than anyother race, Aldaens are born fully capable sorcerors. 

Some Aldaens are born with powers far beyond that of an already advatanged sorceror, correllating with blood purity. 

They have a very deep connection with magic and (unbeknownst to them, the forces of the symphony), and as a result some may possess the ability to "see" magic or immediatly understand the nature of a magical effect or creature.

They have an extraordinary stamina and capacity for magic. Sorcerors of an Aldaen heritage can achieve nearly inexhaustable supplies of magic.

They possess an innate power of bodily regeneration, that can improve with practise.

They are immune to the effects of magical corruption or any magical use related ailment. Their bodies are naturally flooded with magic so only under rare conditions can magic overwhelm them or corrupt their bodies.
