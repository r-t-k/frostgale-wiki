# Oberesk

## Government: 3 Ruling bodies
- Parliament (12 Warden Lords/Lords Paramount, 100 Tribunes (commoners), and 88 High Noblemen)
- Council of Elders (24)
- Monarch

## Recent Kings: 
- Eredyn Oberskyr 5282PC - 5371PC
- Aldric Oberskyr 5371PC - 5436PC 
- Vance Kassadin  5436PC - Present

## Ruling class of a realm:
- Lord Paramount/Governor: Lord or Noble appointed by the King and elected by parliament, responsible for political leadership
	- Grand Artificer: Mage appointed by the Lord Paramount/Governor to be his second in command
- Warden Lord/Guardian: Lord or Noble who owns the majority of land within a realm, responsible for its military leadership
	- Grand Magister: Mage appointed by the Warden/Guardian to be responsible for the infrastructure of the realm
  
  
There must always be a Lord Paramount/Governor and a Warden/Guardian, one man cannot hold both roles. A Warden/Guardian assumes his position hereditarily and by an assessment of his estate and control, his claim (if contested) is assessed by the Council of Elders. The Warden may veto the Lord Paramount, however the king may override his veto unless the Council of Elders is summoned by Parliament to override the King.
